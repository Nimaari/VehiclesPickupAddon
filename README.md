# VehiclesPickupAddon
An open-source addon for the Minecraft plugin Vehicles that allows you to modify whether you can pick up vehicles or not.

Original [plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9C%88%EF%B8%8Fvehicles-no-resourcepacks-needed.12446/) is by Pollitoyeye, I did **NOT** make the Vehicles plugin, I only made an addon for it utilizing its API.

Oh and, you can use the permission ``vehicles.pickupoverride`` if you wish to override the disabled picking up.

Much love to other members of the Vehicles community (https://discord.gg/UubdRghn5S) like Stuart and others <3
